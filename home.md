# teaching 
I teach and have had a hand in the design of many of the systems classes in the CS department, such as 
  - CS361: Computer Systems Programming
  - CS450: Computer Networks
  - CS461: Operating System Design and Implementation
  - CS463: Systems Performance and Concurrent Computing

  as well as CS294: Unix Terminal Bootcamp. I see teaching as the most important part of my job, and thus I spend a great deal of time and effort on my classes. In return, I get high marks on [RateMyProfessors](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/ShowRatings.jsp?tid=1233589) and have received some pretty nice teaching awards such as the [Teaching Recognition Program Award](https://faculty.uic.edu/awards/trp/pastwinners/) (2014), and the [UIC Award for Excellence in Teaching](https://faculty.uic.edu/awards/recognition/aet/aet-recipients/) (2022).
